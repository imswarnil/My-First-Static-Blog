										<h2>Create Your Professional Simple Resume</h2>

									<p>Now you know where is opening , And you are all set to go but, do you have created Resume or CV
										which impress interviewer. If Yes Than Good To Go but those who have not created resume, i will
										suggest give 1 day to make your resume Think what actually are your strength, People Usually write
										comman strength like quick learner , Self Motivated but then interviewer ask give me example where
										you have show quick learning strenghth and then we fumbled and speak anything this is the main cause
										of rejection. this what happend with me. so i learned from my previous mistakes and came up with
										resume where everything i have written was true and reflects my personality. its okay if you know
										only one programming language but be master in it, Don't write just to impress interviewer by
										showing how many skills you know, by writing this you are creating trouble for yourself. write what
										you know.
									</p>
									<p class="bg-success">I have added my resume template if you like you can use it, to create your own.

										<h2>I Joined Jspiders, All You Want to know about Jspiders.</h2>
									</div>
									<p> I Decided To Join Jspiders Because during demo they have clearly mentioned that if you work hard,
										then only you will get job , we assure you to provide quality training, By which you can clear any
										interview, and seriously core java by shishra sir and Sql by dixit sir help me alot , earlier i fear
										"what interviewer ask in technical round"
										but after completing this course, i start thinking
										"i just wish i can clear written round rest next round i can handle easily."" </p>

									<div class="post-title">
										<h3>What Is Fees , And What Jspider teach, </h3>
									</div>
									<p>I have Joined <span class="main-color">Java Developement Course</span> Which Cost Me Around 23000
										Rs. In which they will cover :-
									</p>
									<div class="list">
										<ul>
											<li>Core Java (J2SE )</li>
											<li> Advanced Java (J2EE )</li>
											<li> Basics Of HTML, CSS, Javascript </li>
											<li>Frameworls :- Spring & Hibernate</li>
										</ul>
									</div>

									<p>if You Have fear from coding , what if interviwer asked me to write program, jspider conducts one
										programming class where they cover all the programs with logic which was frequently asked in
										technical interview.</p>

									<div class="post-title">
										<h2>What I Did Was Life Changing For Me </h2>
									</div>

									<p> <span class="main-color">Now This Part Is Most Valuable for all of you</span> already 3 months
										passed, and i have attended more than 10 interviews from jspiders + outside ( I know it's less
										because i am busy attending jspider classes as they consume most of my time, i only get saturday and
										sunday where i used to study what i have studied in coaching but very lightly i am not that much
										serious), you i after long time i realised one thing, in past 3 months i understood what i need to
										study but i am not getting time to study so i decided to quit everything and be serious for my
										studies and job. </p>

									<p>My Coaching almost done now i have time, I Know What To Study So I Decided I wil Not attend any
										walkins in december and i will study hard, what i have studied you can study to get job within 1-2
										months i am fool why i have started all this after 3 months, What I Did :-</p>

									<blockquote class="margin-top-30 margin-bottom-20">

										<div class="list">
											<ul>

												<li>i am utilising most of the my time not going outside home, just trying to finish 2-3 topics
													in one day, in 5 day i have covered all written round topics, all indiabix site important
													questions i solved, you won't belive when i attended walkins later i realised questions are
													repeated all are from indiabix i even don't need to solve i still remember the answers, after
													5 days i started learning java from <span class="main-color">Javatpoint</span> and completed
													that tutorial in 10 days, then next 2 days i have studied 201 java interview questions from
													javatpoint site, and trust me interviewer ask question from these 201 questions only, after
													doing this, I started reading all Java <span class="main-color">Geeksforgeeks</span> article,
													earlier i used to think javatpoint is very tough to understand but after Jspider and
													Javatpoint i am now able to understand geeksforgeeks and also realised how well they have
													written all the articles, GeeksforGeeks if you studied you can crack any interview trust me.
												</li>

												<hr>

												<li>Now i started searching for project, we have created project in collage but i am not
													confident about my project , so i learned one project online and added that one into my
													resume, Note :- Project is important prepare it properly, if you have not contributed in
													project or if its fake, i will suggest you to search project online try to understand how it
													works, How you connect database and all this because interviewer definately ask about your
													project. if you have knowledge about your project you will be confident in interview.</li>
												<hr>

												<li>I am already good in SQL but from one source i got frequently asked questions from SQL in
													interviews i studied all 50 questions, and technical subjects there is one site studytonight
													they have provided short and good tutorials for technical subjects like :- <span
														class="main-color"> Operating System, Computer Networks, Software Engineering, Data
														Structure , Object Oriented Programming </span> and one more source from where i used to
													study Gate Notes By Ankur Gupta
													for technical subjects i have used these refrences, i studied Operating System , OOPs Concept
													, and Data Structure 5 days, and you don't need to study complete subject as it will take too
													much time, i just google top interview questions asked in interview Operating System or
													Subject which i want to prepare because interviewer asked questions from frequently asked
													questions.</li>

												<hr>

												<li>now i have 3 days left in decemeber, i started creating resume along with it i started
													writing "TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF" I have created resume and my introduction in such a way that
													it matches, what ever i speak interviewer can see that whatever i am speaking reflecting my
													original personality not fake, just to give you example, i love dancing and in achievements i
													have added nominated for SPRING FEST From Bhopal Reason for Street Dance Competition. So I
													will Suggest you to give time for you introduction and resume as it play vital role in your
													selection, than last 2 days of december i prepared all HR interview questions according to me,
													Most People just google and whatever answer they get they use in interviews, i will suggest
													you to prepare your own , Note :- Don't Take it lightly When Interviewer ask you where do you
													want to see yourself after 5 years than you will think and give answer, and time you get there
													was less, you may speak something which actually you don't want to speak or you may fumble
													infront of interviewer So prepare before you regret later that i can prepare just because of
													my silly one answer i am rejected, because reaching HR is not an easy task only people who
													struggled for job only they can understand like me. Now Better days yet to come. </li>

												<p>Whatever i have studied i am giving links of all refrences Below which you can also study.
