                            <h3>Story From The Begining</h3>
                            <p>My college, Centre for Converging Technologies, University of Rajasthan, Jaipur.... provides a self finanace 5 years of Integrated Dual Degree Course B.tech with M.tech.First 3 years you have to study the same course and then last 2 years you have to choose your branch as per your interest. There are four major branches in this college which are as follows: - 1. Nanotechnology 2. Biotechnology 3. Information and communication technology 4. Neuroscience.
                                When i joined this college, I didn’t have any idea about which field i would have choose. My father wanted me to choose Nanotech but i was not very much intrested in that. When i was in 1st semester, i never used to attend IT lab because i thought i am not even intrested in this Programming Stuffs. But then in 3rd Semester, i started to learn Java and  i decided to become a Sofware Engineer Only.
                                As I was Coming towards the end of my college days, i went IIT-BHU for my final M.tech Project, where i learnt the basics of Python. 
                                </p>
                          </div>
                            <h2>Decided To Move To  <span class="main-color"><i class="icon-person"></i>Bangalore. </span></h2>
                            <p>The courses provided by our college are mainly research-oriented and therefore companies do not come for campus placements. Students from ICT (information and communication technology) specialisation usually apply for off-campus placements. I tried for certain job opportunities in Jaipur, however the pay scale was not up to the mark there because of which I decided to return home. My parents wanted me to try for government jobs, even though I was not much interested in it. Still I attended few exams but was unable to go through. After much toil and spending around 2 months of time at home, One day I decided to come to Bangalore to search for various job opportunities.</p>
                        
                            <h2>My Life in <span class="main-color"><i class="icon-person"></i>  Bangalore.</span></h2>
                          <p>Bangalore is very happening city so you can have struggle and fun at same time. You can interact with lot of people and learn from them. Everyone comes to Bangalore with a big dream and there was a similar dream in my eyes too.... Those people who do not get job in college, think that bangalore is just a perfect city for them where they can fulfill their dreams.
                              When i came to bangalore, i was feeling very good, a new city, new people  and a hope in the heart.. that everything will be alright now. The best part of Bangalore is the weather here.
                              I didn’t attend any interviews in the first few days of the begining. I Prepared myself a bit like Facebook has some groups  that provide you all the detail of the walkins interviews, just follow nd get all the details from there. Then, finally i thought of starting my journey in Bangalore.
                              </p>

                              <h2>Why i don't Join Any  <span class="main-color"><i class="icon-person"></i>  Coaching / Training Institute Institute</span></h2>
                             <p>There are some coaching institute in Bangalore like Jspider and ABC, that offer full web development or Full testing courses in 24000 Rs.  And also they offer a full gaurantee of the placements as well.  Guys, if you are from IT or CS branch and still you didn’t have any idea about programming but wanted to pursue a career in this field only, then i would suggest to go with these institutes.
                                In my case, i didn’t choose any institution because when i was in my college i had already done 3 months of  Java and SQL training with a coaching institute in Jaipur itself and because of this, there was a little confidence in me. Although, technically i am not very much strong but i felt like not too weak so why to waste my 3-5 months in? I had enough confidence to prepare myself, improve my mistakes and make myself even better.
                                </p>>

                                <h2>Struggle  <span class="main-color"><i class="icon-person"></i>  Begin's</span></h2>
                               <p>Finally i went for my first walkin interview in bangalore, that was a startup company in whitefield and almost 500 peoples were already there just for 3 openings. I was really nervous but i thought this is my first interview so atleast i should try. I waited for 2 hours but till then i didn’t get my chance. Then i came to know that the first round will be GD so i returned back without giving an interview. My first experiance was not so good, i was very scared of GD because i didn’t have enough confidence to speak in front of everyone.
                                  I felt very bad  when i came back to my room, that was my first interview in bangalore and that too i returned without giving it. But i had decided that whatever happens I would have face now so i started preparing for next interviews. After that, i went for some interviews, there were total 3-4 rounds i.e. written(Apti or Technical), F2F (technical+HR) etc.  Towards the beginning I was unable to clear even a single round and i used to get rejected in the first round only but then I decided probably I need to work more towards my skills to get a job. I started studying and gain more practical knowledge to have a clear idea.
                                  After a few interviews, i found a little confidence appeared inside me and now i was able to clear my first round of interview. Slowly, I reached till 2nd and 3rd round of interview. Then, i applied for TCS off-campus, I had a time of 20 days and i thought that in these 20 days i will not go for  any interviews and with all my hard work, I will continue to clear this exam. According to syllabus, I had prepared well but after all this, I could not clear the exam because i couldn’t score well in Apti section.
                                  Still, I did’t loose my hopes and again started to prepare for the next. This time, i was really happy because even though i didn’t clear TCS exam but my hard work started working in my next interviews. Now, I started reaching till last round.  It seemed like now i am just a step away from my dream.
                                  </p>

                                  <h2>All Lost,   <span class="main-color"><i class="icon-person"></i> Everything Black....Black..</span></h2>
                                  <p>I attended at least 20 interviews in different companies to secure a job, but even After all theses, i was not getting any job. It’s very difficult to compromise as a struggler in a new city, new environment with completely new language and food. The PG provide food which is tasteless and sometimes of unmanageable quality. The language problem is also a big stress in transportation and finally The constant rejection in interviews even adds more to this suffering.
                                      But this all things are even manageable, the real depressing moment comes, when your parents calls you and ask how are interviews going on…and with heavy heart i had to say to them that i had no job till now and i am still struggling for this. It feels like the world is ending when I constantly answer my parents that I haven't got any job yet. I don’t even know whether something good will happen or not, what will i do if i have to go back home without a job... Similar questions have begun to bother me. I started feeling like everything is left blank and now all my hopes were over.
                                      </p>

                                      <h2>A Ray Of  <span class="main-color"><i class="icon-person"></i> Hope</span></h2>
                                      <p>But ,this is the real life guys...that we get to face after 4-5 amazing years at engineering where we were careless and happening. But this phase of our life is completely different.. All we get is ..to see the real reality of the world..where only the tough one can survive.
                                          In this bad time, some of my friends always supported me. Goutam, one of my best friend,always brought a possitivity inside me. Swarnil, Another good friends of mine, he also motivated me a lot, preiously he also gone through this struggle, so he knows better my situation in that time.
                                          So,I had decided that no matter what happens I can’t give up easily and again started to make myself better. Finally i came to know that My candiature is on Hold with a good reputed company and a little happiness appeared inside me. I thought  now i will get this job may be after some time but i will get. Still i was not 100% sure so i started giving some non-technical interviews also, just to survive in bangalore. Then I got a Recruiter job in a small company. The salary was very less but i wanted something to survive in banaglore so i did the job.I was not happy with this job because this was not what I wanted. However, I continued to work there for about 2 months to meet my financial needs. While working there I continued to attend interviews in different companies to secure a job that I would love to do.

                                          <p>Lastly, after monhs of hard work, several attempts and struggles, I got a call from a Stratup Company(currently i am working in) that my interview has been cleared and i have been selected.
                                              I was really happy because this was the day that i had been waiting for a long time.Currently I have spent 2 months in this company and I love the work that I do. It is something which I always wanted to do.
                                              </p>

                                              <div class="sub-title">
                                                  <h3>Something For You.</h3>
                                                  <p>Guys....Just keep one thing in mind.Don't Give Up.Don't give up on your dreams.The dreams you had seen while on the way to Bangalore.. The dreams you had when you had planed to come to Bangalore. Live and struggle for that dream. Constantly upgrade yourself and keep pushing yourself forward. Until life gives you what you always wanted.
                                                      Don't just sit at home go outside and explore as much as you can. One of the biggest problem I have seen in people is there ego and fear.They will not go to the walk ins until they get a call, I mean whats wrong in going and trying there if companies are not allowing then its fine but atleast try. Just Dissolve your ego and hesitation and move ahead try hard go as many places you can go for a job.
                                                      Another problem is that people go there but don't learn anything new or not work on their skills they just wait for opportunity Please don't do that mistake In whatever field you want to go prepare for that. Don't believe on luck there are only 5 people in 100 who are lucky but another 95 are hard working. So do hard work don't feel frustrated if someone get job who you assume is less qualified than you leave that thought at that very moment and just do your work and one day you will also get a chance.
                                                      
                                                      As I was a struggler like you, I too had face all these problems..I too woke up every morning with a hope that I will get placed today. I too sometimes skip meals or walk 3–4kms while attending interviews. But I know all these efforts will not go in vein. I will achieve my goals one day. This makes me stronger in this city.
                                                      One more thing.... Currently I am working as a Django Developer and i know a lot of people wants to make a carrier in this field. If you are also one of them,then i would like to tell you friends that your decision is absolutly right because Django is top notch web framework software that can help make developing your website or mobile app much easier.I think the future of Django is closely connected to future of Python language itself.
                                                      Anyway if you're planning to develop websites and web services, Django is perfect starting point. The knowledge of Django will help you to build awesome products and to learn other web frameworks. Just start learning by yourself as much as you can, that will be very helpful. Just make sure you are good enough with the basics of Python, because that is enough to crack any interview. You should Leran from Udemy courses for Python and Django that is very helpful for beginners, Also Documentation is the best guide for every Programming Language.

                                                    <h2>Last but <span class="main-color"><i class="icon-person"></i> not Least.</span></h2>
                                                    
                                                    Only a job seeker can feel that, sometimes you will say that I wish I would be there today like this guy but don't lose yourself and don't let negative thoughts to squander in your mind.
                                                    During this entire phase what I have realized is that, in the current job market, it doesn’t matter how much you know but what matters is how many skills you own and how much confidence you are about yourself......
                                                    So just Be motivated and Believe in your self....... All the Very Best for Your bright Future......
